        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Manuel L. Quezon's life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1878</strong> - Born in Baler Aurora</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1899</strong> - Quezon left his law studies at the University of Santo Tomas to 
            join the independence movement. During the Philippine–American War, 
            he was an aide-de-camp to Emilio Aguinaldo.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1903</strong> - After Philippines surrendered to the Americans in 1900 wherein 
            he made his first break in the American press, Quezon returned to the university 
            and passed the bar examinations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1907</strong> - He was elected as representative of Tayabas's 1st district for the 
            first    Philippine Assembly – which later became the House of Representatives – where he served as 
            majority floor leader and chairman of the committee on rules as well as the chairman also of the  
            committee on appropriations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1909-1916</strong> - He served as one of the Philippines' two resident 
            commissioners to the U.S. House of Representatives, lobbying for the passage of the Philippine 
            Autonomy Act or Jones Law.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1916</strong> - Quezon returend to Manila and was elected senator of the Fifth Senatorial 
            District. He was later elected Senate President by his peers, serving continuously until 1935 (19 
            consecutive years), the longest serving in history, until his younger province-mate from Tayabas, 
            Senator Lorenzo Tañada's four consecutive terms (24 years from 1947 to 1972). He headed the first 
            Independent Mission to the U.S. Congress in 1919 and secured the passage of the Tydings–McDuffie 
            Act in 1934. In 1922, Quezon became the leader of the Nacionalista Party alliance Partido 
            Nacionalista-Colectivista.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1935</strong> - Quezon won the Philippines' first national presidential election under the 
            banner of the Nacionalista Party. He obtained nearly 68% of the vote against his two main rivals, 
            Emilio Aguinaldo and Gregorio Aglipay. He is recognized as the second President of the Philippines.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1935</strong> - President Quezon started a vigorous program of social justice, 
            which he introduced through appropriate executive measures and legislation obtained 
            from the National Assembly. Commonwealth Act No. 20 authorized Quezon to institute 
            expropriation proceedings and/or acquire large landed estates to re-sell them 
            at nominal cost and under easy terms to tenants thereon, thus enabling 
            them to possess a lot and a home of their own. Upon the creation of the 
            Commonwealth, the economic condition of the nation was stable and promising.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1936</strong> - When the Commonwealth Government was established, 
            President Quezon implemented the Rice Share Tenancy Act of 1933. In 1936, 
            this Act was amended to get rid of its loophole, but the landlords 
            made its application relative and not absolute. Consequently, 
            it was never carried out in spite of its good intentions. - Created the National 
            Council of Education. Funds retained from the early approved Residence 
            Certificate Law were devoted to the maintenance of the public schools 
            all over the nation and the opening of many more to meet the needs of the young people.
            - Announced Tagalog as National Language.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1937</strong> - President Quezon initiated women's suffrage 
            in the Philippines during the Commonwealth Era. As a result of the 
            prolonged debate between the proponents of women's suffrage and 
            their opponents, the Constitution finally provided that the issue 
            be resolved by the women themselves in a plebiscite.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1938</strong> - President Quezon enlarged the composition 
            of the Council of State through Executive Order No. 144. This highest of advisory 
            bodies to the President was henceforth to be composed of the President, 
            the Vice-President, Senate President, House Speaker, Senate President 
            pro tempore, House Speaker pro tempore, Majority Floor leader of both 
            chambers of Congress, former Presidents of the Philippines, and some 
            three to five prominent citizens.
          </li>
          <li><strong>1939</strong> - the United States Congress enacted a law 
          embodying the recommendations submitted by the Joint Preparatory 
          Commission on Philippine Affairs. Because the new law required an 
          amendment of the Ordinance appended to the Constitution, a plebiscite 
          was held on 24 August 1939.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1940</strong> - In a notable humanitarian act, Quezon, 
            in cooperation with United States High Commissioner Paul V. McNutt, 
            facilitated the entry into the Philippines of Jewish refugees 
            fleeing fascist regimes in Europe while taking on critics who 
            were convinced by fascist propaganda that Jewish settlement was 
            a threat to the country
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1942</strong> - President Quezon addressed the United States
             House of Representatives, impressing upon them the vital necessity 
             of relieving the Philippine front. Before the Senate, later, the 
             Philippine President reiterated the same message and urged the 
             senators to adopt the slogan "Remember Bataan". 
             Despite his precarious state of health, President Quezon roamed 
             the States to deliver timely and rousing speeches calculated to 
             keep the Philippine war uppermost in the minds of the American nation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1943</strong> - Philippine government-in-exile was faced with a serious crisis.
            According to the 1935 Constitution, the official term of President 
            Quezon was to expire on 30 December 1943 and Vice-President Sergio 
            Osmeña would automatically succeed him to the presidency.
          </li>
          <li><strong>1944</strong> - dies at the age of 65.</li>

            is the Quezon Service Cross. He is also memorialized on Philippine currency. 
            He appears on the Philippine twenty peso bill. The "Open Doors" is a 
            Holocaust memorial in Rishon LeZion, Israel. It is a 7-metre (23 ft) 
            high sculpture designed by Filipino artist Luis Lee Jr. and erected 
            in honor and thanks to President Manuel Quezon and the Filipinos who 
            saved over 1,200 Jews from Nazi Germany.
